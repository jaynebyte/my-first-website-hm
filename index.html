   I'm a 24-year-old idealist who has a strong desire to experience life on my own terms and discover new things. My curiosity, passion, and eccentricity fuels me as I spend my time studying everything I can about how the world around us functions. 
    I try to learn something new every day through articles, podcasts, and online courses.
    I'm currently in the process of figuring out my path by diving into random things to see which one clicks. Currently, I've got my eye on leveling up my skills, doing my hobbies and cuddling my cats & dogs.</p>

    <h2 style="background-color: bisque;">I <ins>love</ins> this song! ヽ(✿ﾟ▽ﾟ)ノ It's called <big>Oras</big> by <sup>
   Munimuni</sup></h2>
<audio controls autoplay mute loop src="/music/Oras.mp3" height="200" width="400">
</audio>
<p>I dedicate this song to the inevitable deaths, the joy and tragedy that lies therein when you're a human being. For the loved ones that I will always miss and the innocent child that I used to be.</p>
